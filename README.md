# CelebFaceClassifier
This repository contains the implementation of a celebrity face recognition system using advanced neural network architectures. The project compares the performance of multiple models, including CNN (Adam and SGD optimizers), AlexNet, DenseNet121, VGG19, and ANN, on a custom dataset of celebrity faces.
